\chapter*{Abstract}
One central theme of number theory is the distribution
of the prime numbers over the positive integers.
In one direction,
from the works of
Hadamard, de la Valle\'e Poussin, and Newman,
we know that the PNT (Prime Number Theorem)
can be worked by Complex Analysis methods.
On the another direction,
Selberg, Breusch, and Levinson proved the PNT
using elementary techniques in the sense that
it uses only Real Analysis.
Less than a decade ago,
Choudhary has strengthened Levinson's proof.
All the elementary proofs mentioned above
derive the PNT using Selberg's identity.

In this thesis,
we establish another proof for the Selberg's identity
simpler than Choudhary's in many respects.
This is done by refining the works discussed previously.
We also present a linear time algorithm for
estimating a formula derived from Selberg's identity.
